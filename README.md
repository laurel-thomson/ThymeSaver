# ThymeSaver

This is a recipe, meal planning, pantry, and shopping list management app for Android.  It allows users to store their recipes, keep track of their pantry contents, schedule their meals for the week, and create a shopping list.  The shopping list automatically populates based on the ingredients in the recipes that have been scheduled for the week and the contents of the pantry.  Users can either log in as a guest or they can create an account, which allows them to share their pantry with another user.
